## Quilt Generator (AKA Quilt.B)

Quilt Generator is a procedural quilt pattern generator implemented in JavaScript. By changing parameters, such as the types of block patterns, the color palette, and the frequency that each is repeated, the code generates a unique quilt pattern. The generator can match up edges to create cellular automata-like patterns. I created this generator with an intent to sew a real quilt based on one of these patterns.

## Next Steps

1. Refactor the code to be more readable and maintainable by through modular class design
2. Update align edge code to work on all blocks types
3. Update align edge code to work with multiple colors
4. Create interface to manage quilt generation without code

## Technologies Used
